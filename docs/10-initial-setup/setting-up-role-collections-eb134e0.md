# Setting Up Role Collections

To configure user access and permissions, set up role collections for the different roles available for SAP Cloud Transport Management.

After successful subscription, you need to configure user access to the application. You create different role collections for the different SAP Cloud Transport Management roles, and assign roles to the role collections based on the application templates. Afterwards, you assign the role collections to users or user groups.

For the *LandscapeOperator* and the *Viewer* roles, SAP Cloud Transport Management delivers the *TMS\_LandscapeOperator\_RC* and *TMS\_Viewer\_RC* role collections. You don´t need to set up role collections for these two roles.

> ### Note:  
> It's possible to create new role collections and add the roles to the new role collections directly after creating the collections, which would prevent you from having to switch between different views in SAP BTP cockpit. However, we recommend that you add the roles in the *Roles* tab of the **subscription details**. This is useful, because all template roles relevant for the service are displayed there.
> 
> The following steps describe the recommended procedure.

You find the roles delivered for the service in the subscription details on the *Roles* tab.

1.  To get there, in your subaccount, choose *Services* \> *Instances and Subscriptions*.

2.  On the *Subscriptions* tab, in the *Cloud Transport Management* row, choose <span class="SAP-icons-V5"></span> \(Actions\) and *Manage Roles*.

    > ### Note:  
    > If you've opened the *Roles* view of your subaccount by choosing *Security* \> *Roles*, you see the role templates available for the `alm-ts` application, which is relevant for the user interface of SAP Cloud Transport Management. ![](images/alm-ts_Roles_in_Subaccount_c6a491c.png)
    > 
    > Even though you can set up the role collections in this view, we don't recommend to do this as described previously.
    > 
    > Depending on your entitlements, for example the role templates of the `alm-ts-backend` or `alm-ts-dev` applications can also be displayed. It's **not** necessary to add roles to these applications, because access is enabled using service instances, and the role assignment implicitly happens through the selected instance plan. For more information, see *Step 3.3* in the topic [Creating a Service Instance and a Service Key](creating-a-service-instance-and-a-service-key-f449560.md).
