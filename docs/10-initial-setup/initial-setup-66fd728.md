## Prerequisites

-   You're a global account administrator.
-   You've set up your global account and at least one subaccount on SAP BTP. For an overview of the required steps, see [Getting Started in the Cloud Foundry Environment](https://help.sap.com/docs/BTP/65de2977205c403bbc107264b8eccf4b/b328cc89ea14484d9655b8cfb8efb508.html).

## Context

SAP Cloud Transport Management is offered using the *Consumption-Based Commercial Model*.

For more information about the consumption-based commercial model, see [Commercial Models](https://help.sap.com/docs/btp/btp-admin-guide/basic-platform-concepts?version=Cloud#loio263d40009a5a4237a62e8f5c05ee641e) in the *SAP BTP Administrator's Guide*.

> ### Tip:  
> SAP Cloud Transport Management service is an *additional* service that must be integrated into the existing development processes of the cloud services or applications whose content it transports. Moreover, the service can be integrated into the change management processes of other services or tools. We recommend that you always start reading the documentation of the application whose content you want to transport to learn about the required configuration tasks.
