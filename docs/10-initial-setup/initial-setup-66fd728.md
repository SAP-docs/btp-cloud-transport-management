## Context

> ### Tip:  
> SAP Cloud Transport Management service is an *additional* service that must be integrated into the existing development processes of the cloud services or applications whose content it transports. Moreover, the service can be integrated into the change management processes of other services or tools. We recommend that you always start reading the documentation of the application whose content you want to transport to learn about the required configuration tasks.
