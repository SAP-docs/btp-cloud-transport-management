# Landscape Action Logs

The landscape action logs display the history of all actions related to landscape configuration.

This includes actions such as create, edit, and delete transport nodes, transport routes, and scheduled import jobs.

The log displays a list of landscape actions sorted according to the time when the action was performed. The most recent action is at the top. For each action, it contains information about the user and, for each *Edit* action, it contains the data from the previous state \(*Old value*\) and the new state \(*New value*\). For *Create* or *Delete* actions, one of the states *Old value* or *New value* is always *None*. Import schedules are displayed using *cron* expressions.

You can filter the columns *Type*, *Action Type*, and *User* by entering any character string in the *Search* field. Note that you cannot use the *Search* field for text displayed in any of the other columns.
