# Creating Destinations for Deployment of References of SAP BTP, ABAP Environment

To address the target end point of the deployment process of references of SAP BTP ABAP environment, create a destination to the target instance of SAP BTP ABAP environment where you want to deploy your content references.

## Prerequisites

In the target instance of SAP BTP ABAP environment, you've created an instance of the communication scenario `SAP_COM_0948` using the *Communication Arrangements* app. For this, you've created a communication system with an inbound communication user that uses *User ID and Password* as the *Authentication Method*.

For more information, see the following topics in the documentation of SAP BTP ABAP environment:

## Context

You can use SAP Cloud Transport Management service to transport references to ABAP coding in Git repositories that was created in SAP BTP ABAP environment.

This topic describes how to create a destination to SAP Cloud Transport Management using the `MANAGE_SOFTWARE_COMPONENTS` API and `SAP_COM_0948`. This is the recommended approach. This API supports the import of all transport requests in an import queue. For selected transport requests, *Import Upto* is available which ensures that all previous transport requests in an import queue are imported together with the selected request.

## Procedure

1.  In SAP BTP Cockpit of your subaccount in which you are subscribed to SAP Cloud Transport Management, choose *Connectivity* \> *Destinations*.

2.  In the *Destinations* editor, choose *Create* \> *From Scratch* \> *Create*.

3.  Enter or select the following values:

4.  Choose *Create* to create the destination.

5.  **Optional:** After creating the destination, click anywhere in the row to display its details.

6.  **Optional:** Choose *Check Connection* to check your destination.

    The result should display *HTTP request \(without authentication\) to *<Name of the destination\>* destination succeeded*.

    > ### Note:  
    > This result means that the URL specified in the destination can be reached. However, such a successful check doesnâ€™t guarantee successful deployment. We recommend that you test the deployment using a test transport after completing all configuration steps required for your transport scenario.
    > 
    > For more information about connection checks, see [Check the Availability of a Destination](https://help.sap.com/docs/CP_CONNECTIVITY/cca91383641e40ffbe03bdc78f00f681/71ea3ccf4ebc4c63a3989c0b318e3e9b.html).
