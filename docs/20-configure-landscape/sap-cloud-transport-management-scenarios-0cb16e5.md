# SAP Cloud Transport Management Scenarios

You can use SAP Cloud Transport Management to transport content archives directly from within an application's source environment to a target environment. If there's no export integration of SAP Cloud Transport Management in the source environment, you can use the service to upload content archives from a local file system and import them in a target environment.

-   **Transport of Content Archives directly in another Application**

    In this scenario, another application whose content archives you want to transport, such as SAP Cloud Integration, is directly integrated with SAP Cloud Transport Management service. You can transport content archives directly from within the application's source environment to the target environments of the application. You can then use SAP Cloud Transport Management to import the content archives in the target environments.

-   **Transport of Content Archives that are available on Local File Systems**

    In this scenario, the content archives that you want to transport between different environments, are downloaded in the application of the source environment. They are then available on your local file system. You can use SAP Cloud Transport Management to upload the content archives to the import queue of the target environments and import them there.
