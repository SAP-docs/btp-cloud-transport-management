# Creating Destinations for MTA Deployment on Cloud Foundry

For MTA deployment on Cloud Foundry, you have different options to configure transport destinations to address the target endpoint of the deployment process.



<a name="loio881d7520f6ff44e18a4ef4411cbdeed2__context_wly_zns_gwb"/>

## Context

The following services can be used for deployment:

-   SAP Cloud Deployment service

    Default option for MTA deployment on Cloud Foundry.

    If you want to use a custom identity provider for the platform user used for the deployment, use *OAuth2Password* authentication for the destination.

-   SAP Content Agent service

    To transport content of API Management and SAP Cloud Integration together, use this option.


For more information about the option that is relevant for your use case, also see the application-specific documentation. You can find a list of known integrations and links to application-specific information under [Integrating the Service](../70-integrations/integrating-the-service-7e966f7.md#loio7e966f73645c42eca1bf19e719b21ceb).
