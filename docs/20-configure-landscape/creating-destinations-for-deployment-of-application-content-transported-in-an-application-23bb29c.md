# Creating Destinations for Deployment of Application Content Transported in an Application-Specific Format

To address the target end point of application-specific content deployment, specify a destination using the details from the provider of the application content.



## Procedure

1.  In SAP BTP Cockpit of your subaccount, choose *Connectivity* \> *Destinations*.

2.  In the *Destinations* editor, choose *Create* \> *From Scratch* \> *Create*.

3.  Enter or select the following values:

    <tr>
    <td valign="top">
    
    *URL*
    
    </td>
    <td valign="top">
    
    The application specifies a URL to the deploy end point of the destination as well as the other details of the destination.
    
    </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td valign="top">
    
    *Authentication*
    
    </td>
    <td valign="top">
    
    Please use the authentication type required by the deploying application, for example, *OAuth2ClientCredentials* authentication with a client credential flow. Here, you have to configure a destination with authentication *OAuth2ClientCredentials* where the *Client ID* and the *Client Secret* are needed that you get from the application or service instance created in the target tenant. In addition, you have to specify the *Token Service URL*, pointing to the authentication service used, for example `https://ts.authentication.sap.hana.ondemand.com`, which is also provided by the application or service instance created in the target tenant.
    
    </td>
    </tr>
    </table>
    
4.  Choose *Create* to create the destination.

5.  **Optional:** After creating the destination, click anywhere in the row to display its details.

6.  **Optional:** Choose *Check Connection* to check your destination.

    The result should display *HTTP request \(without authentication\) to *<Name of the destination\>* destination succeeded*.

    > ### Note:  
    > This result means that the URL specified in the destination can be reached. However, such a successful check doesnâ€™t guarantee successful deployment. We recommend that you test the deployment using a test transport after completing all configuration steps required for your transport scenario.
