## Integration of SAP Cloud Transport Management Using APIs

To propagate applications, or application-specific content using SAP Cloud Transport Management service in an integrated way, you can use the Cloud Transport Management API. Use the Cloud Transport Management Version Endpoint API to ensure that the version of this API is supported by SAP Cloud Transport Management service.

The Cloud Transport Management API offers operations for uploading a file to SAP Cloud Transport Management service and to perform the export on a specified transport node. If a physical file is transported, the *File Upload* is always the first operation, followed by *Node Export*, or *Node Upload*. Itâ€™s also possible to perform a transport based on a reference, where a file upload isnâ€™t needed.

Use *Node Export*, if you want to enable the transport of content directly in your application. The previously uploaded file or a specified reference is attached to a new transport request that is added to the import queues of the follow-on transport nodes of the export node.

Use *Node Upload* in continuous integration scenarios, for example, where you have an external content or application archive \(MTA, for example\) that you want to upload in the first transport node of your transport landscape. You can also use it to upload content or applications to a specific subaccount or tenant that isnâ€™t part of your standard transport landscape, for example a training subaccount or tenant.

If you want to use the Cloud Transport Management API for export operations, perform the following steps:

1.  Create a package that contains your content.
2.  Call the File Upload operation of Cloud Transport Management API \(only required for file-based transport\).
3.  Depending on your use case, call one of the following operations, and pass the ID of the uploaded file \(or the reference, for reference-based transport\):
    -   *Node Export*
    -   *Node Upload*


In addition, the Cloud Transport Management API offers operations for importing, forwarding, and resetting one or many specified transport requests as well as an operation for importing all transport requests of a node. Each of these operations produces a transport action that you can retrieve using the *Get transport action* operation. The *Get transport requests* operation is available for imports to get transport requests of a specified node.

Typically, an import is an asynchronous operation, which you should monitor by retrieving the import action while the action status is *running*. Use the *Get transport logs* operation to get the logs of a transport action, and the *Get transport request logs* operation to get transport request-specific logs.
