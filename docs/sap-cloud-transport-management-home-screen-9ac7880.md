### Transport Management

On the *Transport Management* section on the home screen, you get an overview of imports and about the transport nodes with pending transports.



### Import Overview

The pie chart gives an overview of the imports. You can select the time interval for which you want to display the chart, and you can directly navigate to the relevant *Transport Action Logs*.



### Top n Nodes

The list contains transport nodes whose import queues have the highest number of transports in an importable state. These are transports in one of the following statuses: *Initial*, *Fatal*, or *Repeatable*. To navigate to the import queue of a specific transport node, click anywhere in the row.

For more information, see [Create Transport Nodes](20-configure-landscape/create-transport-nodes-f71a4d5.md).



### Landscape Management

On the *Landscape Management* section on the home screen, you can navigate to the *Transport Landscape Wizard* or to the *Landscape Visualization* to configure your transport landscape.



### Access Wizard

Access the *Transport Landscape Wizard* that allows you to easily configure simple transport landscapes. If you know the number of transport nodes of which your landscape will consist, you can configure the landscape using a template.

For more information, see [Use the Transport Landscape Wizard](20-configure-landscape/use-the-transport-landscape-wizard-f14192e.md).
