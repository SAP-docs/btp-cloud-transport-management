## Context

Transport requests serve as containers for transporting content. Transport requests can contain different content types \(files or references\). By default, they are created automatically whenever files are added to import queues of transport nodes. These transport requests contain one file and cannot be changed. You can create modifiable transport requests that let you add multiple files and test their deployment before releasing them to production environments.

To manage transport requests, choose <span class="SAP-icons-V5">îƒ„</span> Transport Requests from the navigation pane in the SAP Cloud Transport Management user interface.

All transport requests in a tenant are displayed in a list. For each transport request, the list displays the ID, description, creation date, owner, the size of the files attached to the transport request, and a lifecycle status. By default, all transport requests in status *Released* and *Open* are displayed. For more information, see [Statuses of Transport Requests](statuses-of-transport-requests-3a8259e.md).
