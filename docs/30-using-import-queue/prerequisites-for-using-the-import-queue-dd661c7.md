# Prerequisites for Using the Import Queue

To use the import queue, open it and have the appropriate authorizations.

-   Depending on the action that you want to perform in the import queue, you need different authorizations.

    For more information, see [Security](../60-security/security-51939a4.md).

-   You have opened the import queue of a transport node using one of the following options:
    -   On the SAP Cloud Transport Management home screen, choose <span class="SAP-icons-V5"></span> Transport Nodes from the navigation pane. On the *Transport Nodes* screen, select the transport node you want to access the import queue for.

    -   In the *Landscape Visualization* screen, choose <span class="SAP-icons-V5"></span> \(Go to this node's import queue\).
