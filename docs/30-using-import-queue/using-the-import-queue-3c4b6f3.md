		transport requests only.")**  
You can either import all transport requests in an import queue, or selected transport requests only.
-   **[Forward Transport Requests](forward-transport-requests-630fae7.md "If the Forward Mode of a transport node is set to the value Manual, you can manually forward
		selected transport requests in this node to target transport nodes.")**  
If the *Forward Mode* of a transport node is set to the value *Manual*, you can manually forward selected transport requests in this node to target transport nodes.
-   **[Reset Transport Requests](reset-transport-requests-e56b4a2.md "To repeat the import of transport requests in status Error or Succeeded, you can reset the
		status of these transport requests.")**  
To repeat the import of transport requests in status *Error* or *Succeeded*, you can reset the status of these transport requests.
-   **[Remove Transport Requests](remove-transport-requests-e4e92ed.md "You can remove selected transport requests from an import queue.")**

-   **[Upload MTA Extension Descriptors](upload-mta-extension-descriptors-0c7a672.md "If an extension descriptor file exists for a Multitarget Application (MTA) that you
		want to import, you can upload it in the import queue of the corresponding transport node of
			Cloud Foundry
                                environment.")**  
If an extension descriptor file exists for a Multitarget Application \(MTA\) that you want to import, you can upload it in the import queue of the corresponding transport node of Cloud Foundry environment.
