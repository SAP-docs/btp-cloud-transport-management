# Forward Transport Requests

If the *Forward Mode* of a transport node is set to the value *Manual*, you can manually forward selected transport requests in this node to target transport nodes.

## Prerequisites

-   You have one of the roles *Administrator* or *TransportOperator* assigned to your role. For more information, see [Security](../60-security/security-51939a4.md).

-   You are in the import queue of the transport node where you want to forward transport requests. For more information, see [Prerequisites for Using the Import Queue](prerequisites-for-using-the-import-queue-dd661c7.md).
-   The *Forward Mode* of the transport node is set to the value *Manual*. For more information, see [Create Transport Nodes](../20-configure-landscape/create-transport-nodes-f71a4d5.md).
-   The archive that is attached to the transport request isn’t deleted.

    Forwarding transport requests is only possible as long as the archive exists. The default retention period of archives depends on the service plan that you use for SAP Cloud Transport Management. For more information, see [Background Information: Storage Capacity](../50-administration/background-information-storage-capacity-e8d5187.md).

-   The transport requests that you want to forward are in one of the statuses *Error*, *Skipped*, *Succeeded*, or *Warning*.



## Context

If the forward mode of a transport node is *Manual*, no automatic forwarding takes place. You can manually select individual transport requests in the current import queue that you want to forward. Forwarding takes place into all target transport nodes according to the transport routes defined for the node where the import is started.



## Procedure

1.  In the import queue, select one or multiple transport requests that you want to forward.

    The transport requests are forwarded in the same order in which you selected them. This allows you to influence the order in which the transport requests are placed in the target import queue.

2.  Choose *Forward*.

## Results

The selected transport requests are added to the import queue of the target nodes.

The forwarded transport requests are added to the end of the import queues of the target transport nodes. If the forwarded transport requests are already part of the import queue of the target node, they’re moved to the end of this import queue. The status of a moved transport request changes as follows:

-   *Initial* remains *Initial*.
-   *Deleted*, *Error*, *Fatal*, *Skipped*, *Succeeded*, and *Warning* change to *Repeatable*.
-   *Repeatable* remains *Repeatable*.
