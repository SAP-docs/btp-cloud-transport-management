# Contributions to the SAP Cloud Transport Management Documentation

Found a mistake in our documentation? Always wanted to add a step in one of our procedures that could save many others much time? Then you're at the right place! All contributions made to the Markdown files in the [docs](docs) directory are reviewed, and if deemed valuable be added to our [official documentation on SAP Help Portal](https://help.sap.com/docs/cloud-transport-management?version=Cloud). The easiest way is to start there, and choose _Edit_ to find the right Markdown file to contribute to.

## Requirements

For contributions, it's required that you have a GitHub account. For more information, see [Signing up for a new GitHub account](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/signing-up-for-a-new-github-account) in the GitHub documentation.


## Contributing

We recommend using the [SAP Cloud Transport Management](https://help.sap.com/docs/TRANSPORT_MANAGEMENT_SERVICE/7f7160ec0d8546c6b3eab72fb5ad6fd8/5fef9d6b1cb047b2b18d9eb57aa15352.html?locale=en-US&state=PRODUCTION&version=Cloud) documentation on SAP Help Portal as a starting point for contributions:

1. Open the [SAP Cloud Transport Management Documentation](https://help.sap.com/docs/TRANSPORT_MANAGEMENT_SERVICE/7f7160ec0d8546c6b3eab72fb5ad6fd8/5fef9d6b1cb047b2b18d9eb57aa15352.html?locale=en-US&state=PRODUCTION&version=Cloud).
1. You can either:
    * Choose *Feedback* > *Edit page* to suggest a change for the current page you see in the Help Portal viewer, or
    * Choose *Feedback* > *Create issue* to open a GitHub issue in this repository.

If you only make a small contribution, that's the quickest way to propose a change. For larger contributions, we recommend forking this repository to work locally. The filenames in the [docs](docs) directory are created based on the title of the page on SAP Help Portal.
